OpenDyslexic is a thoroughly researched typeface designed against some common symptoms of dyslexia.

OpenDyslexic Mono belongs to a family that includes regular, bold, italic, and bold-italic styles.

Designer Abbie Gonzalez says

> [OpenDyslexic] was created to help with my reading, and is being updated continually and improved based on input from other dyslexic users. â€¦ Letters have heavy weighted bottoms to indicate direction. You are able to quickly figure out which part of the letter is down, which aids in recognizing the correct letter and sometimes helps to keep your brain from rotating them around. Consistently weighted bottoms can also help reinforce the line of text. The unique shapes of each letter can help prevent confusion through flipping and swapping.

Even for coders who do not personally experience symptoms of dyslexia, adopting OpenDyslexic Mono helps keep accessibility concerns in front of you and your users.
