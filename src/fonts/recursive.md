Built to maximize versatility, control, and performance, Recursive is a five-axis variable font. This enables you to choose from a wide range of predefined styles, or dial in exactly what you want for each of its axes: _Monospace, Casual, Weight, Slant, and Cursive_. Taking full advantage of variable font technology, Recursive offers an unprecedented level of flexibility, all from a single font file.
