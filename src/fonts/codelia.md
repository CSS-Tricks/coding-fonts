Codelia is a monospaced humanistic typeface designed for coding with focus on comfort and fun without sacrificing legibility or coding functionality. Its round shapes are easier on the eyes and make the code look less intimidating. It is not designed to make maximum use of every pixel on screen, but to make you forget about pixels.
