Meslo LG is a customized version of Apple’s Menlo-Regular font
(which is a customized Bitstream Vera Sans Mono).

I really like Menlo but I do have my nitpicky gripes with it:

The default vertical (line) spacing is just way to cramped for me, and also
I am not particularily fond of the horizontal baseline alignment of the asterisk.
That’s why I decided to customize Menlo, regarding these “issues”.
The tricky part is keeping all the custom tables, hints, etc. intact when you
adjust the globally very affecting stuff that results in vertical spacing.

The LG in Meslo LG stands for Line Gap. The idea behind it is to allow the user
to have some control over vertical spacing by choosing one of three line gap
variants: small, medium and large (Meslo LG S, Meslo LG M and Meslo LG L respectively).

The DZ stands for dotted zero.
