Meslo LG is a customized version of Apple’s Menlo-Regular font
(which is a customized Bitstream Vera Sans Mono). It widens the
characters slightly and adjusts the horizontal baseline alignment
of the asterisk.

The LG in Meslo LG stands for Line Gap. The idea behind it is to
allow the user to have some control over vertical spacing by
choosing one of three line gap variants: small, medium and large
(Meslo LG S, Meslo LG M, and Meslo LG L respectively).

There is also a DZ version of each of these fonts (Meslo LG S DZ,
Meslo LG M DZ, and Meslo LG L DZ), which replaces the slash version
of the zero character with one with a center dot.
