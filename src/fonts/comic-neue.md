Comic Neue is an original reinterpretation of the classic, Comic Sans.

> Comic Neue aspires to be the casual script choice for everyone, including the typographically savvy. The squashed, wonky, and weird glyphs of Comic Sans have been beaten into shape â€“ while maintaining the honesty that made Comic Sans so popular.

It was not created for coding, but with a bold font weight it works okay.

The Comic Neue project was initiated by Craig Rozynski, a designer living in Australia and Japan. To contribute or report any issues, see [github.com/crozynski/comicneue](https://github.com/crozynski/comicneue)
